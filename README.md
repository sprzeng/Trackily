# Trackily
[Trackily](https://trackily.azurewebsites.net) is an issue tracker web app that helps support application development through Tickets which track issues and feature requests.

I developed Trackily in order to get my feet wet with web development. My primary learning goals for this project were to:
- Create a web app end-to-end using an MVC architecture and deploy it
- Implement CRUD actions with an ORM and relational database
- Implement authentication & authorization

I wrote a retrospective on my experience developing Trackily [here](https://medium.com/@spr.zeng/a-retrospective-on-my-first-web-application-565f4601f3bb).
